# Simple.ex

Simple is a rather rubbish interpreted language, created as I read through the
first few chapters of Tom Stuart's excellent [Understanding Computation][book].

The version here differs from the one in the book in that it has slightly
different semantics, and it's written in Elixir and Erlang rather than Ruby.
